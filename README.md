# compile-csv-files
Compiles CSV files in Windows PowerShell

This script assumes that the user has downloaded a lot of CSV files (all in the same folder) with same column headers and needs to manually compile all the content by highlighting and copy-pasting on MS Excel. 

Therefore, the script allows the user to choose which columns to export into a final compiled file.
