# compile-csv-files
Compiles CSV files in Windows PowerShell

This script assumes that the user has downloaded a lot of CSV files (all in the same folder) with same column headers and needs to manually compile all the content by highlighting and copy-pasting on MS Excel. Therefore, the script allows users to choose which columns to export into a final compiled file. The code selects column headers 'test1" and "test2", feel free to edit to your own headers.
